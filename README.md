# Typescript Template

This is a template for the **TypeScript** projects. You can install it easily and start coding right away.

## Important

I recommend to use **yarn** instead of **npm** because **yarn** faster.<br>[**Click here**](https://yarnpkg.com/) if you want to get more information about yarn.

## Installation

```
yarn install
```

## Scripts

-   `yarn clean` **➜** _Deletes the **dist** folder_
-   `yarn build` **➜** _Builds the project_
-   `yarn start` **➜** _Stars the project_ **(You must build the project before starting)**
-   `yarn dev` **➜** _Starts the project as dev_
